lding a server requires integrating system components into an architecture that
meets specific server design requirements. Each server is designed with a set of
subsystems to create a balanced, high-performance, and cost-effective computer
architecture. Server architecture is tested throughout the design and manufacturing
process.
Some of the key components found in industry standard servers include system
boards, processors, chipsets, buses (I/O interconnects), memory, storage
components, power, and mechanical components (for example, server chassis)
