lding a server requires integrating system components into an architecture that
meets specific server design requirements. Each server is designed with a set of
subsystems to create a balanced, high-performance, and cost-effective computer
architecture. Server architecture is tested throughout the design and manufacturing
process.
Some of the key components found in industry standard servers include system
boards, processors, chipsets, buses (I/O interconnects), memory, storage
components, power, and mechanical components (for example, server chassis)

Adding extra lines here

Servers can run many programs simultaneously and process requests for data from
many users at once. To ensure performance, the system architecture in a server is
designed to eliminate or minimize bottlenecks that affect the speed at which
information is accessed or processed. The system architecture also provides high
availability, networking, and management features

 hello  this is last line.
